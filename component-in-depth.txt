-- What is a Component?

A component is a reusable and self-contained unit that encapsulates a specific
piece of functionality or user interface. Components are a fundamental 
building block of Vue applications, and they allow you to organize and
structure your code in a modular way.

-- In Simple Terms

A component is like a building block for your website. Imagine it as a small,
reusable part of your webpage that you can easily use in different places.
It's like Lego blocks, in a way that you can use them over and over again to
build different things.

-- Analogy

Imagine you're building a website about travel. You might have different
sections like a header with the logo and navigation links, a main section with
destination information, and a sidebar with travel tips. In Vue, each of these
sections can be a component.

So, a component in this context is like a building block for your website.
You have a header component, a main content component, a sidebar component,
and so on, Each component does its job well, and you can combine them to create
a complete and functional travel website.
